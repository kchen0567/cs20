    <p> My favorite place is this lake near my friends' house. It is not an actual lake but an artificial one in their neighborhood. 
        I have a lot of memories in this place,  because it was where my friends would gather and play after school when we were kids. 
        There are a lot of cute animals like ducks, geese, and rabbits around too.</p>
